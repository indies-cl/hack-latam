# hack@latam

let’s code for a better world.

# who we are

indies.la is a collective of 1.5k+ latin american builders.  
we sit at the intersection of:

- indie hackers
- YC-backed founders
- non-profits and open-source

# track record

- 1.5k+ members across latam
- monthly events with around 75 in-person attendees
- companies in the community have shipped real products and raised capital
- strong overlap with top-tier ecosystems (y combinator, platanus, chilean startup scene)

indies.la is where ambitious latam builders already hang out.

# the event

hack@latam. late april 2026, 48 hours, fully focused on social impact.

- 150 hand-picked participants
- ages 20–35
- software engineers, cs students, founders, high-agency techies
- application-based selection to filter for people who actually ship

goal: turn latent talent into founders building for latin america.

# what makes this different

- deployed software only
- clear tracks tied to real problems
- judges with domain expertise
- follow-ups with teams that show traction

most hackathons optimize for photos, not outcomes. we seek real change.

# themes & tracks

we focus on four fault lines in latam.  
each track is about data, coordination, and real-time action.

1. transparency & corruption

problem: opacity kills trust and progress.  
angle: use data to expose, track, and reduce corruption.

2. community welfare

problem: coordination failures at local level.  
angle: software for organizing, helping, and acting together.

3. public safety & emergency response

problem: emergencies move faster than institutions.  
angle: real-time information and coordination for crises.

4. environment & climate risk

problem: water, contamination, fires, and climate risk.  
angle: track, predict, and mitigate environmental damage.

# format & judging

- 48-hour build sprint
- teams form around tracks and local pain points
- deployed MVP required for judging (live demo, not slides)

judging criteria:

- real problem, clearly targeted
- working product, not just mockups
- path to continue post-hackathon
- impact potential in latin american context

each track judged by practitioners in the field.  
we are already in conversations with civic tech, non-profit, and policy leaders to sit on the jury.

# why this matters

latin america is full of unsolved problems:

- fires in the south, floods and droughts across the region
- weak infrastructure, fragile institutions, and opacity
- communities solving things locally with almost no tools

we are not importing silicon valley’s problems.  
we are building for latam’s reality.

hack@latam is a forcing function: put top local talent together, ship code on real problems.

# why sponsor

you want access to the people who actually build the future of latam.  
hack@indies concentrates them in one weekend.

as a sponsor, you get:

- talent access: direct line to 150 vetted builders and future founders
- product usage: your tools battle-tested by real teams under real constraints
- brand positioning: visible support for high-agency, execution-focused talent
- recruiting pipeline: early relationship with people who will start and join important companies
- case studies: real projects using your stack in meaningful social impact contexts

# sponsor fit

ideal sponsors:

- devtools: ai, infra, hosting, apis, data, observability
- cloud and infra providers
- VCs and funds serious about latam dealflow
- companies with strong engineering cultures looking for talent

if your product is better in the hands of sharp builders, this is where to put it.

# the ask

we are raising:

- $5k usd cash for the prize pool
- credits for infrastructure, ai tooling, databases, and related dev tools

tool credits:

- get your stack into production use
- turn hackathon projects into long-term users
- generate real-world case studies in social impact

# what you get

for sponsors, we commit to:

- clear branding in all event materials and online assets
- explicit “powered by” mentions on relevant tracks and tooling
- intro sessions or workshops if you want to showcase your product
- opt-in talent directory: profiles and links for participants who want to be visible to sponsors
- post-event report: projects, traction, and how your tools were used

this is structured to be measurable, not fuzzy.
